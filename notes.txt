okay, next i should add a button that i can click that will change the source of the audio

what's next?

smooth transitions?
or the scrolling feature?

how about i put some pictures in that correspond to the songs

and then change the source depending on which one you're looking at?

and then i could make it so the volume transitions from max to 0 as you move to the edge of one picture

then i could add a static channel that's constantly playing whose volume is the inverse of the currently playing song
