okay, next i should add a button that i can click that will change the source of the audio

what's next?

smooth transitions?
or the scrolling feature?

how about i put some pictures in that correspond to the songs

and then change the source depending on which one you're looking at?

and then i could make it so the volume transitions from max to 0 as you move to the edge of one picture

then i could add a static channel that's constantly playing whose volume is the inverse of the currently playing song

$('#switch').click(function() {
              sourceIndex += 1;
              if(sourceIndex >= sources.length)
              {
                sourceIndex = 0;
              }
              audio.src = 'audio/' + sources[sourceIndex]['audio'];
            });
			
it'd be cool if you could set songs to be played at either day or night

2 is channel 2 at its quietest
2.5 is channel 2 at its loudest
3 is channel 2 at its quietest
